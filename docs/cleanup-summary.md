# Cleanup Summary - Migration to Phaser 3

## What Was Removed

### Django Game Implementation
- **Battle System**: Removed Django-based battle views and templates
  - Deleted `/templates/battles/` directory
  - Removed `battle_manager.py` 
  - Simplified `battles/views.py` to redirect to Phaser game
  - Removed `BattleActionView` from URLs

### Static Assets
- Removed `/static/js/game.js` (Django-specific game logic)
- Removed `/static/css/battle.css`
- Removed `/templates/game/` directory (old templates)
- Removed hero placeholder image references

## What Remains

### Backend Infrastructure (Django)
1. **Authentication System**
   - User registration and login
   - Player profile creation

2. **API Layer** (`apps/api/`)
   - REST endpoints for Phaser to communicate with backend
   - Player data persistence
   - Battle tracking
   - Progress saving

3. **Data Models**
   - `Player`: User progress, stats, inventory
   - `Enemy`: Enemy definitions
   - `Battle`: Battle history and rewards
   - `Location`: World locations
   - `Quest`: Quest definitions
   - `Lesson`: Python educational content
   - `Challenge`: Coding challenges

4. **Educational Content** (`apps/lessons/`)
   - Python lessons remain in Django
   - Challenge system for learning
   - Progress tracking

### Frontend Game (Phaser 3)
Located in `/static/game/`:
- `config.js`: Game configuration and state management
- `main.js`: Game initialization
- `scenes/`: All game scenes (Boot, Preload, MainMenu, World, Battle, UI)
- `assets/`: Placeholder for game assets

## Architecture Overview

```
User → Django (Auth/API) → REST API → Phaser 3 Game
                ↓
          Database (SQLite)
            - User data
            - Progress
            - Lessons
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phaser Integration**
   - Connect Phaser scenes to Django REST API
   - Implement player data loading/saving
   - Add real game assets (sprites, audio)

2. **Polish Game Features**
   - Implement Python-based battle system in Phaser
   - Create world exploration
   - Add lesson integration in game

3. **Testing**
   - Test authentication flow
   - Verify API endpoints work with Phaser
   - Ensure progress saves correctly
